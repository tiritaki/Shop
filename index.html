    <p>
      &quot;As a <strong>[type of user]</strong>, I want/need to
      <strong>[perform an action]</strong> so that
      <strong>[the intended result]</strong>.&quot;
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Searching for Solutions</h3>
    <p>
      During the discovery phase, users are searching online for a potential
      solution to the issues and challenges they’re frequently experiencing.
      They’re also comparing your product to different platforms to see which is
      the best fit for their needs. Writing user stories at this stage helps you
      identify which features you should build within your product and how to
      showcase them on your website.
    </p>
    <h3>User Stories:</h3>

    <p>
      “As an eCommerce business owner, I need a solution that automates all the
      repetitive tasks that come with inventory management, so I can free up my
      schedule and focus on more important tasks.” <br>
      “As a project manager at a
      large company, I want a platform that comes with task delegation
      functionality and a reporting feature, so I can track my remote team’s
      progress more efficiently. <br>
       “As a freelancer who works with clients outside
      my country, I need a payment solution with low transaction fees that
      allows me to invoice companies, so I can stop losing money on each project
      I complete.”
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Registering &amp; Creating an Account</h3>
    <p>
      As the user is about to register and start using your product for the
      first time, they have a couple of expectations and objectives in mind that
      you must address in advance. These are often related to security,
      integrations, and inviting others to the platform.
    </p>
    <h3>User Stories:</h3>
      <p>
        “As an eCommerce business owner, I want to easily synchronize my store
        with the inventory management platform during registration, so I don’t
        have to add all of my products manually later.” <br>
      
        “As a project manager, I want to invite other team members to this
        project management platform, so they can help me review it and determine
        if it helps them be more productive.” <br>
      
        “As a freelancer, I want to be able to add two-step verification to the
        registration process to add an extra layer of security to my login and
        make sure no one else besides me has access to my payments/invoices.”

    <h3>Step 3: Purchasing Your Product</h3>
    <p>
      In order to get users to convert into paying customers, there can’t be any
      friction during the purchasing process. Otherwise, you’ll be left with
      abandoned carts and missed opportunities. User stories identify these
      issues in advance to find solutions in the product experience to solve
      them.
    </p>
    <h3>User Stories:</h3>
    <p>
      
        “As an eCommerce business owner, I want to be reminded how many days are
        left in my free trial of the inventory management tool so that I know
        when I need to make my final decision.”
      <br>
      
        “As a project manager, I need a custom pricing plan since I manage many
        people in different departments at the same time and have complex
        needs.”

        “As a freelancer, I want to be able to make my purchase via different
        methods (PayPal, credit card, bank transfer, etc.), so I can choose
        which one fits me the best.”
      
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4: Onboarding</h3>
    <p>
      The onboarding process could make or break your user retention. The goal
      at this stage is to get users started as quickly as possible and to direct
      them to the features that are most important to them.
    </p>
    <h3>User Stories:</h3>
    <p>
      
        “As an eCommerce business owner, I want to be able to go through a
        product tour of the inventory management tool so that I can get a clear
        understanding of its key benefits.”

        “As a project manager, I want to create and delegate my first task as
        soon as possible (within the first 10 minutes), so I can instantly see
        the value that the product has to offer.”
      <br>
      
        “As a freelancer, I want to create a sample invoice first to get an idea
        of what the process would be like when invoicing clients and receiving
        payments.”
      
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5: Retaining Users</h3>
    <p>
      Your product success depends on retaining customers long-term. Not only
      does it bring more revenue, but a high retention rate is proof that your
      product is meeting the needs of your target audience.
